Cycosports Race Analysis

This project analyses a publicly available race timings dataset from https://cycosports.com/. 

In the first notebook, an exercise in data wrangling is done when we try to get the information into a tidy data format as defined by Hadley Wickham. 

In the second notebook, visualisations and some exploratory data analyses are generated to derive some insights. 

The CSV files of the initial and cleaned data are included in this repo.
